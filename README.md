# **Introduction**

This project aims to predict the likelihood of customer defaulting on their credit card payments in Taiwan. Predicting the estimated probability of default is valuable for risk management purposes, providing insights beyond binary classification.

**Business Objective:**

The goal is to predict the likelihood of customers defaulting on their credit card payments in Taiwan. This prediction is essential for risk management purposes.


# **Models Used**

To achieve our goal, I explored and evaluated several machine learning models:

**Logistic Regression:** A fundamental model for binary classification tasks, providing insights into the probability of credit card defaults.

**Random Forest:** A powerful ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. Random Forest excels in capturing complex patterns in the data.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A model capable of finding the optimal hyperplane to separate data points, often used for binary classification tasks.

**XGBoost Classifier:** A gradient boosting algorithm known for its high predictive accuracy and versatility.



# **Evaluation Metrics**


Model performance was assessed using the following evaluation metrics:

**Recall:** A crucial metric for identifying defaulters, measuring the ability to correctly identify positive cases.
**F1 Score:** A balanced metric considering both precision and recall, providing an overall measure of model performance.
**KS Statistic:** A metric measuring the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes, important for credit risk assessment.

# **Conclusion **
